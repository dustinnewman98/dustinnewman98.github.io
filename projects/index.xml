      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in the Go programming language for a bit, largely due to the huge ecosystem exploding around it lately. Especially in web services (Mattermost, Keybase, Uber, etc.) and deployment tools (Docker, Kubernetes), there have been so many amazing new tools built in the language that I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to see what the excitement was all about. And, as a web-loving programmer, I had particular interest vested in the merits of Go.</description>

      <description>This was the first Daily Bruin project I created entirely on my own. It was common to come into the office with blue papers (design notes) strewn about every which way on all sorts of tables, filled with mark ups and notes. Aside from being a huge paper waster, design notes were also inefficient and required editors to physically be in the office to complete them. While this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem during the school year, over the summer, designers had to hunt down editors through Slack to get the necessary information for that day&amp;rsquo;s paper.</description>

      <description>This was my first introduction to TypeScript. At the time, I was a fish out of dynamically typed water. Although I felt very comfortable in C/++ and was no stranger to the type system in those languages, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what a &amp;ldquo;type system&amp;rdquo; was, much less that I was familiar with it! I knew JavaScript and React, but the entire concept of a &amp;ldquo;typed JavaScript&amp;rdquo; was inexplicable to me.</description>
