Hi there! 👋

My name is Dustin and I'm a Linguistics and Computer Science 🌳 major at [UCLA](https://ucla.edu) 🐻, graduating June 2020. I am also an incoming software engineer at [Qualcomm Atheros](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/networking) 📶. I am primarily interested in backend development and low-level engineering 🐞, such as embedded systems, operating system kernels, and networking stacks. Basically, I love C. 🍊
