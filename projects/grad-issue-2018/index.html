  <div class="post-content"><p>This was my first introduction to TypeScript. At the time, I was a fish out of dynamically typed water. Although I felt very comfortable in C/++ and was no stranger to the type system in those languages, I didn&rsquo;t even know what a &ldquo;type system&rdquo; was, much less that I was familiar with it! I knew JavaScript and React, but the entire concept of a &ldquo;typed JavaScript&rdquo; was inexplicable to me.</p>
<p>After browsing the TypeScript homepage and looking through React examples though, I got enough of an understanding to push through. It took a late night and a lot of compile errors, but I got the hang of it and I’m grateful I did because it turned out to be my favorite page I&rsquo;ve ever made!</p>
<p>The design, made by Callista Wu, a Design editor at the Daily Bruin, is sleek but not bland; attention-grabbing but not invasive. The timeline is responsive and, except for a Safari bug, surprisingly robust. The colors are perfectly complementary, a great tie in to UCLA, and overall brilliant. I also really learned proper encapsulation for React apps here: how to effectively divide UIs into composable components. Most of the credit, however, goes to Callista for her phenomenal work.</p>
