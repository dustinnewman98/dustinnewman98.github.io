## Ingredients

- 1 onion, diced
- 2-3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- Pinch of kosher salt to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Red pepper flakes, to taste
- Dried oregano, to taste
- Dried thyme, to taste (optional)
- 2 cloves of garlic, peeled
- 1 (4.5 oz) tube of tomato paste
- 1/3 cup vodka
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 lb rigatoni pasta
- Generous salt for pasta water
- Freshly grated parmigiano reggiano cheese (at least a 1/2 cup)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Chopped fresh parsley to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat a large pot of water to cook your pasta. While it heats, start making the sauce.
2. Cook your onion with the olive oil and salt in a large pan over medium heat until translucent and slightly golden. Add black pepper, red pepper flakes, oregano, and thyme and cook 1-2 more minutes. Add in the garlic.
3. Add the tomato paste and continue to cook over medium heat for 2-3 more minutes. Stir continuously.
4. Add the vodka; let it simmer briefly before adding the heavy cream. Turn off the heat once the cream simmers for a minute. Use a spoon to remove the garlic cloves that have now infused the sauce.
5. Salt the pasta water once it's boiling and add in your rigatoni. Cook 2-3 minutes less than the lower number on the package. Reserve at least a half cup of pasta water before draining the pasta.
6. Mix the drained pasta into the pan with the sauce, along with a splash of pasta water and a generous amount of parmigiano reggiano and the butter. Return the pan to heat, and let the pasta simmer in the sauce for the last couple minutes of its cook time. Add the parsley and enjoy.
