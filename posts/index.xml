      <title>Does Twitter invite outrage?</title>

      <description>Out of all the social media, it‚Äôs no secret that Twitter is where you‚Äôll get ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù for comparing Raya and the Last Dragon to Avatar: The Last Airbender (or similarly trivial infractions) by mobs of trigger-happy enrag√©s. Of course, public outrage is certainly nothing new, much less the invention of Twitter. There are complex social, political, and intellectual roots to the various online discourses we see now, far too many to elaborate in one blog post.</description>

      <title>Headache Design</title>

      <description>I am genetically prone to get headaches and migraines. Since I was around five or six, I have learned a variety of coping mechanisms, from taking pain relievers early to hot baths to green lights. 1 Looking at a screen is never good for head pain, but in 2021, we can‚Äôt always avoid it. Sometimes it‚Äôs for work, sometimes it‚Äôs for paying a bill or other bookkeeping, other times it‚Äôs just for fun because who wants to lay in bed alone in the dark with a warm washcloth for hours?</description>

      <title>Real CS Curriculum</title>

      <description>As I‚Äôm approaching my first full year in industry after school, I‚Äôve noticed the divide between what‚Äôs taught in class versus what you use day-to-day more than ever. Now don‚Äôt take this the wrong way. I‚Äôm certainly not advocating higher education becomes a bootcamp or saying the theoretical doesn‚Äôt matter. It very much does and, even though it‚Äôs become a meme to poke fun at whiteboarding interviews or algorithm questions, I still definitely believe those are essential to any long-term career in engineering/programming.</description>

      <title>Is Cyberpunk cyberpunk?</title>

      <description>0. Genesis In the beginning, there was the steam engine. Or actually, there wasn‚Äôt.
Cyberpunk visionary William Gibson remarked in a 2011 interview with The Paris Review:
 ‚ÄúSo I didn‚Äôt think it was terribly original, my concept of cyberspace. My anxiety, rather, was that if I had thought of it, twenty or thirty other science-fiction writers had thought of it at exactly the same time and were probably busy writing stories about it, too.</description>

      <description>I was going through basic LeetCode problems recently after hitting a frustrating snag in a real project and I came across a Problem. An easy problem. But an interesting one. Well, this is LeetCode we‚Äôre talking about so maybe ‚Äúillustrative‚Äù is a better word. It‚Äôs an illustrative problem.
I‚Äôm talking about the ‚ÄúBuy and Sell II‚Äù problem which essentially boils down to finding the sum of increasing intervals. Ah, I have just the solution for this!</description>

      <title>This blog is built with Hugo</title>

      <description>It took around a minute and a half for this site to build with GatsbyJS and what came out after was a near horrifying mess of ‚Äúbundle split‚Äù JavaScript files and all sorts of underscores. Overall, it totalled up to over 88 kB! And that was just for my index page with a couple paragraphs and a nav bar. Spoiler alert but after switching to Hugo, I can build in less than 30 seconds with a sane output format consisting of just TWO kB (for the home page).</description>

      <title>Domain Name Change</title>

      <guid>https://dustinnewman.me/posts/domain-change/</guid>
      <description>What was formerly dustinnewman.io has now been moved to dustinnewman.me! This includes not just my posts, but also my subdomains (twitter.dustinnewman.io is now twitter.dustinnewman.me).
I did this after reading that draw.io was moving to diagrams.net and after reading some 1 good 2 articles 3 about the issue. My only shame is that this issue really broke in 2014 and I‚Äôm only just now hearing about it six years later! But better late than never and better my money go to the right people than the wrong.</description>

      <title>Concurrency Masterpost</title>
      <link>https://dustinnewman.me/posts/concurrency-masterpost/</link>

      <description>Concurrency is at the heart of network programming. Most of networking is presumably I/O bound and as such it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to waste precious CPU cycles simply waiting for responses. To solve this, we structure our programs to be concurrent, dividing a problem into independent sections such that each concurrent unit may execute the sections in any order. Different concurrency and concurrency control mechanisms have been proposed in the past 60 years and I thought it would be helpful to have a reference point comparing them all.</description>

      <title>Tags as Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://dustinnewman.me/posts/tag-set-theory/</link>

      <description>As a former Tumblr-er, there was nothing more frustrating about that site than the tagging system. Aside from the near-universal problem of &amp;ldquo;this tag&amp;rdquo; vs. &amp;ldquo;thistag&amp;rdquo; vs. &amp;ldquo;This tag&amp;rdquo; vs. ad infinitum, I have yet to see a tagging system that allows set theory operations. What if I want to see posts analyzing the parallels between Taylor Swift‚Äôs &amp;ldquo;reputation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Lover&amp;rdquo;? Sure, I can search &amp;ldquo;reputation,&amp;rdquo; but then I have to sift through mostly irrelevant details to find the hidden gems.</description>

      <title>How to use CSS with native dark mode</title>
      <link>https://dustinnewman.me/posts/dark-mode-css/</link>

      <description>With iOS 13, I have been enjoying not just the beautiful new dark mode, but the automatic transition after sunset. It&amp;rsquo;s easier on my eyes and keeps me conscious of using technology too much before bed. That said, the native dark mode is only for native apps. Or is it?
I thought it would be nice if there were CSS selectors capable of targeting users&#39; native preferences on the matter and luckily Apple did not disappoint.</description>

      <description>Hello there! This is my very first post on my new website! üéâ (Let&amp;rsquo;s hope emojis work properly.)
This site will replace my old personal website, a handmade GEOS-OS simulator, which was very beloved to me, but not so much to everybody else. üòì What you see right now is my attempt at a more &amp;ldquo;professional&amp;rdquo; (read: conventional) portfolio, although the actual &amp;ldquo;portfolio&amp;rdquo; part of that is questionable due to the as-of-yet unfinished projects page.</description>
