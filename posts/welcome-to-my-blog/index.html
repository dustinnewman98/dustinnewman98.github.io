<p>This site will replace my old personal website, a handmade GEOS-OS simulator, which was very beloved to me, but not so much to everybody else. üòì What you see right now is my attempt at a more &ldquo;professional&rdquo; (read: conventional) portfolio, although the actual &ldquo;portfolio&rdquo; part of that is questionable due to the as-of-yet unfinished projects page. Like the subtitle reads, please excuse the dust!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be using this site periodically to post my more polished and/or helpful thoughts, for random readers or potential employers (üòâ) alike. I&rsquo;m sure it will go through many iterations, as my aesthetic preferences swing rapidly from ultra-minimalist to fervent anti-design. Speaking of which, if my random thoughts ON design interest you, then tune in (hopefully there will be RSS feeds and newsletters soon), because I have A LOT to say.</p>
<p>Oh, and I do apologize for the rather plain home page. I&rsquo;m trying to find a good free (in the economic sense of the word (more on &lsquo;free&rsquo; later)) library for SVG animations. Right now, anime.js looks very promising.</p>
<p>Signing off from Texas,
Dustin ü§†</p>
