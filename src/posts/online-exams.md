One of the classes I’m enrolled in this quarter is going to have our last exam online. Since this class is planned to be taught solely online starting next year, I am in the last in-person offering of the course and they want to see how online-only tests will work. Not surprisingly, moving tests out of the lecture hall and into the browser introduces a lot of complexity that’s trivial when in-person. How do you prevent cheating? What if the Internet connection goes out? What if the server crashes? And so on. 

For someone whose life and livelihood largely revolves around computers and all the various things they should, shouldn’t, or need to do, I‘m actually very suspicious of digitizing things. Doctor’s appointments, job interviews, and now exams are just a few examples that come to mind. Forget that the Web [wasn’t built to withstand intentional, malicious attacks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/05/30/net-of-insecurity-part-1/) or handle secure information like Social Security Numbers. It’s that the Web wasn’t built to emulate the real world at all. It was built in the bowels of CERN, a research organization. It was built as an **information system**, not an interactive system. The Web was created with the intention to represent documents with specific, unique identifiers, which could be used to “link” other documents together. A documentation system, for a research organization. 

Obviously, the Web has come a long way since then and it’s far from an internal CERN project, approaching an entire parallel reality of its own. So, one might argue that it’s a little pointless to argue about “intent” and what the Web was “meant” for or “supposed” to be. It is what it is after all, and it’s being used for things far beyond merely static documents. However, the intentions driving the design of a system create an immutable, lifelong structure which greatly affect its usability, limitations, and capabilities. 

So, when we have an online-only exam, we have to download a browser called “LockDown” which does not allow tabs or multiple windows, refuses to run when certain “blacklisted” applications are also, and disables many other common browser functions. In order to have some small guarantee against cheating still, we will also be recorded by our computer’s camera during the duration of the exam. Aside from raising privacy concerns (although IT says only the professor will have access to any footage), this is the perfect example of running into the limitations of a system which was not designed for exams, and then grafting on layer upon layer of progressively more complicated and questionable mechanisms to just *approach* the benefits the physical testing environment inherently provides. The payoffs, it seems to me, are far dwarfed by the costs, but let’s go through some of them anyways.

1. You can take the test any time, any where.

In our case, this isn’t even true since we must take the exam at our usual lecture time anyways. But even still, this doesn’t make sense. If we can take the test anytime, then what is preventing one person from taking the exam with their friends out of sight of the camera and then sharing the test questions after? Especially if you have multiple LockDown exams, students will quickly form study groups/sacrificial circles where they take turns taking the test first to share the questions. The “any where” claim is strictly true (provided you have a reliable, speedy internet connection which isn’t even true at UCLA itself (eduroam is “out of reach” far too often and “UCLA Web” insists you don’t check emails)), but by enrolling in the class, we have all set aside a certain time slot for this class already. Since we all have to be in lecture, we already have one set time slot that will work for everyone: lecture! So why don’t we take the exam… in lecture?

2. You can take the test at home.

Oh, where I have mail-people, plumbers, and friends of other tenants stopping by? Where my brain is primed for “comfort” mode instead of “study” mode? I personally do not study well at home. I find myself making tea or doing laundry or moving around to the other millions of little distractions that an environment like, say, a *lecture hall* is specifically designed to eliminate. 

3. It’s good for people with anxiety.

Is it really? Yes, you won’t have to suffer the pains of pushing your way through hordes of other students. But now you have plenty of other worries with no seeming answer or remedy: what if my internet connection goes out, what if I have a question, how do I ask a TA for help, what if my computer dies, what if I can’t focus at home, what if I don’t feel comfortable at home, what if my roommates are always home, I can’t focus   when I’m being recorded and monitored, and so on! 

4. It’s good because computer and technology.

Technology is supposed to make your life easier and facilitate things you couldn’t do otherwise. This is doing neither. 

5. It’s easier to grade. 

Scantrons have existed for years and seem to be a perfectly reasonable automatic grading solution that don’t require internet connections, webcams, and medieval-made browsers. They do require a number two pencil and careful bubbling but at least the former can surely be afforded by the university over a proprietary browser license.
