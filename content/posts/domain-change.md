What was formerly dustinnewman.io has now been moved to dustinnewman.me! This includes not just my posts, but also my subdomains (twitter.dustinnewman.io is now [twitter.dustinnewman.me](http://twitter.dustinnewman.me)).

I did this after reading that draw.io was moving to diagrams.net and after reading some [^1] good [^2] articles [^3] about the issue. My only shame is that this issue really broke in 2014 and I’m only just now hearing about it six years later! But better late than never and better my money go to the right people than the wrong. Also, the "input output" appeal of the io domain didn't really apply to this site anyways, as there is no real input to this site, just output. My output. Me! For this reason, I’ve chosen the me cc-TLD which goes to support the country of Montenegro.
