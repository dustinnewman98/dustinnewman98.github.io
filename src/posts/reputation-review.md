It is rare to get a mainstream artist honestly, painfully, and fully describe the details of a breakdown or public falling out. But when they do, it can be the fire on the side of the road you just can’t look away from. Britney Spears’ *Blackout* and now Taylor Swift’s *reputation* come to mind, both tearing away the curtains of long-cultivated public images to reveal a rougher, more genuine truth. Both albums saw the American sweethearts at their worst, with failing relationships, public feuds, and media criticism shoved into the foreground of their narratives. If I had one wish for Taylor’s take, though, it would be to be more like Britney’s: to be more radical, more extreme. However, seeing as *reputation* was the highest-selling album of 2017, marking the fourth time Taylor has surpassed the 1 million opening week sales mark, it’s safe to say this was a reasoned choice. In fact, much of the album reflects Taylor’s incomparable cleverness and, dare I say, brilliant thinking. These are somewhat bold claims so let’s take a deeper look to see what I mean.

## Release
A week before the lead single was released, Taylor blacked out all social media including her website. This would later become clear as a reference to “killing off” the “Old Taylor.” Two days later, she posts a grainy video of a snake tail. Over the next two days, she posts two more videos, completing the snake with a snapping bite. On the final day of the snake reveal, she also - without any other warning or hint - drops the album title, cover art, and release date. It is here that we must discuss some of my favorite parts of the release!

*reputation* was released on November 10, 2017: 11/10/2017. Her previous album, *1989*, was released on October 27, 2014. Between those two dates, there are 1,110 days. 1110. 11/10. She released *reputation* exactly the same amount of days after *1989* as the date itself. This also marked the three year anniversary of the release of her single “Blank Space,” which was a parody of her **reputation** that the media had constructed of her. Genius already! 

Also, once you consider this minimal promotion for the lead single, “Look What You Made Me Do,” it makes it all the more impressive that the song broke the Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube records for the most streamed single in 24 hours. Now that we’ve talked about the release date, we get to analyze the cover itself, one of the most iconic (or notorious) pieces of the discussion.

## The Cover
The cover for *reputation* is a style of design known as “anti-design,” which emphasizes deliberate violations of common design practices; obnoxious and excessive use of typography and text; asymmetrical placement; stark, bold, and often clashing color choices; and repetition of text, among other things. There are many perceived or conceivable implications of this (from showing a rejection of establishment to capitalizing on meme culture), but I won’t be discussing those here. Rather, what is important is that the album cover has a symbolic meaning representing the entire album theme as a whole: that there are two sides to every person. There is the true side, free of remark and judgment, and there is the public side, that culmination of words, ideas, and stories of that person often seen before its counterpart, i.e. their *reputation*. Here, we see Taylor literally split into black and white. Either she is perfect and clean, the so-called “Old Taylor,” or she is hated and demeaned. The judgments of her, much like the album cover itself, are harsh, stark, and polarizing. Either you love it/her or you hate it/her. There is no in-between. This also hearkens back to a closing line in the album’s opener:

> There will be no further explanation.
>
> There will be just reputation.

The words which cover Taylor’s face get in the way of actually seeing her. Her reputation literally precedes her. Of course, we must also point out that the many many iterations of her name are references to newspapers and magazines, both places she was branded a liar, manipulator, or faux victim. This drives home the point even further: that the words about her obscure her actual personhood. In my opinion, it was not so much actual print newspapers that partook in this (because they are of higher professional standards usually), but digital “newspapers” or glorified blogs which get retweets on their inflammatory headlines that were the worst offenders. But I guess those publications have a less dramatic aesthetic to them. 

On the cover, Taylor breaks tradition and faces the camera dead center. The meanings for this are fairly straight-forward; she is no longer shying away from material as she has done in the past. There are fewer filters on her now. This carries over to the rest of the album, where Taylor takes unprecedented steps in her career, openly cursing, talking about sex, and drinking. In the past, she has used tangential references (“I’ll do anything you say if you say it with your hands,” “Lights are off, he’s taking off his coat,” etc.) for sexual activities, but - as we will see later - on *reputation* she strips away all those frills, bushes, and petals and has, for all it’s worth, the truth. 

Taylor also wears two interesting pieces of clothing on the cover: a chain necklace and a carefully torn sweater. The chain around her neck represents how she has been bound to her reputation for almost all her life, the level of control it has had over her (as she later explains in “Delicate”) to the point where it’s choking her. Taken with the theme of crime throughout the entire album and the direct, head-on style of the album cover, this is Taylor’s mugshot. She feels imprisoned by her reputation and by people who do not care for her having huge amounts of control over her. This goes with both her relationship with the media and her record label, who were at the point of selling her entire body of work to one of Taylor’s tormentors. It is also worth noting how unfair a picture this cover paints: anyone and everyone can say anything they want about her, damaging her reputation in the process, but she can’t say anything back in defense. The chain will also become important later, as we will see in “Call It What You Want.” Compare an approximation of the *reputation* CD lyric booklet with the following mugshot of Suzanna Somers:

The sweater is interesting due to the chain-stitched tear on her right shoulder, which has exactly five triangular circuits running between the tear. Each circuit represents each of Taylor’s past five albums. Due to her rather confessional songwriting style, each album represents another time Taylor has had to stitch herself back together after experiencing heartbreak. And she will do the same this time. Despite her reputation being tarnished, these stitches remind us that Taylor has done this at least five times before, and this will be just another battle scar she bears. It is a subtle, but extremely powerful symbol.

Now that we have discussed the meta information of the album, the rest of this post will be a track-by-track analysis of *reputation*.

# ...Ready For It?
This song literally begins with Taylor clearing her throat, signaling that she is ready to let loose, which also perfectly matches with our previous idea that the chain on the cover shows us how she has traditionally bit her tongue. No longer. She metaphorically and literally clears her throat to let the listener know that what will follow is a departure from her usual music. 

And boy is it! The track, sonically, features harsh, “crunchy” bass lines reminiscent of both Britney Spears’ “Piece of Me” and Kanye West’s “On Sight,” both of which opened their respective albums as well! This seems to be a common trope then in the genre of albums-made-during-breakdowns.

Lyrically, Taylor opens saying she “knew he was a killer,” immediately introducing the theme of crime which carries throughout the rest of the album. Here, her and her lover are both criminals, which will become important as *reputation* chronicles how Taylor, despite committing social “crimes,” found true love and companionship. Already, she and her lover  are a match made in Hell! What is also interesting is the power dynamics of this verse. Taylor says that if “he’s a ghost / then I can be a phantom / holding *him* for ransom,” where the emphasis on “him” is my own. Notice how Taylor is the one with the power here, not the man! This is a departure from her previous works which feature the man as the active character. The man drives the car, breaks her heart, lies or cheats, etc. Here, she is the active perpetrator. 

Ending the first verse, Taylor says “I keep him forever / Like a vendetta,” highlighting two central themes: love and revenge. These are weaved throughout the album in its entirety, and this presents a perfect example. 

Now, we arrive to the chorus and I must introduce a potentially confusing concept: the real Taylor is in the choruses. Remember how in our discussion of the cover art, I mentioned there are two sides to Taylor presented? Well, the verses of the songs generally represent the “public” Taylor whereas the choruses (chori?) represent the “true” Taylor. This split is done both lyrically and musically, with verse Taylor pseudo-rapping and chorus Taylor singing more melodically. So, when Taylor bombastically declares she holds her lover for ransom and keeps him forever like she does her grudges, that, much like “Blank Space,” is a parody of her reputation. That is what people think of her as, but it is not her true self. Her true self is revealed in the choruses. Notice the much softer proclamation “I know I’m gonna be with you, so I’ll take my time” compared to the verses. It sounds much more like Old Taylor, right? That soft, romantic sentiment? 

The pre-chorus also has an interesting line stating that if her lover touches her, “he’ll never be alone,” which at face value is a sweet, devotional lyric promising her companionship. However, it also has a double meaning reflecting the contagious, dangerous power of her fame. As Taylor has seen time and time again, her celebrity creates nearly insurmountable challenges on top of the existing, inherent difficulties of relationships. Considering both meanings, this line perfectly reflects the compelling dichotomy that is Taylor Swift: at once, both a heartfelt romantic from a small town and the biggest pop star in the world. “No one has to know,” Taylor sings, but does she really believe that? 

And then the eponymous “Are you ready for it?” launching the second verse. This line, as well as the title, have multiple meanings, as do most things on the album. It of course serves as an album opener to us listeners asking us if we are ready for the dramatic face-heel turn Taylor will be taking, but also as an in-universe question to her lover, to whom it has much more gravity. She is asking him if he is ready for the onslaught of publicity, media hounds, speculation, and gossip. Once you consider that this line is straight between both the true Taylor chorus and the parody Taylor verse, between the genuine concern over her reputation and the brash rhetorical question, its placement is nothing short of genius. It serves as a perfect bridge between the two Taylors, having different meanings for each. 

Taylor draws from the story (and pun) of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in the second verse to make the comparison between her and her lover. This is not just an apt comparison of famous couples, but a tie back to the general **reputation** of Taylor Swift. Like Liz, Taylor finds her art and talent minimized at expense of vapid gossip about her love life. Of course, there is a certain irony to this, as it is exactly the virulent gossip in the first place which adds to the pressure of dating while famous, thereby increasing the likelihood of a breakup, which just generates more gossip! The magazines have really worked out this one. “Planes, trains, everything stops for Elizabeth Taylor, but the public has no conception of who she is,” Roddy McDowall tellingly said about Liz Taylor and I think both the comparison to Taylor Swift and the context of being in *reputation* speaks for themselves. 

The crime theme also continues through the second verse as Taylor says her lover “can be her jailer.” That is, he can imprison her. Compared to earlier, where we see Taylor is imprisoned or controlled by her reputation, this is shifting the control instead to someone who supposedly cares about her. We will talk more about this in “So It Goes...” and “Call It What You Want.”

## End Game
A morning after the gritty bombast of the previous track, “End Game” starts with gentler, listerine green synths and the chorus. This track gives us insight into Taylor’s state of mind in ways the other, more aggressive earlier tracks of *reputation* don’t. The linearity of the album is not a strict chronological linearity, but rather an emotional, personal linearity, describing Taylor’s journey from one state of mind to another. Here, we see her desire for more from her current relationship. She wants to be her lover’s “end game,” that is his goal romantically. However, the term “end game” also refers to few final moves finishing a game of chess, suggesting that Taylor feels she is playing a calculated game here. She *wants* to be his end game but it’s clear that they both have reputations for breaking hearts and it’s very unclear what is actually going to happen. 

Cross-referencing a bit, I believe the lover described is the same from *Lover*’s “I Forgot That You Existed.” In “End Game,” Taylor wants to be his “first string,” and it’s clear that she is ready to commit more deeply to him. Likewise, in IFTYE she says she would have been “first row, even if nobody came to [his] show.” Both of these lines express similar devotional attitudes towards him, but it’s unstated what his position in all of this is. 

Once again, the two central themes of love and reputation feature here, but in a much lighter, optimistic way than they do in “Delicate.” Taylor knows that her reputation is problematic and is trying to ease that pain and judgment by escaping into a relationship. What is interesting is her saying that she doesn’t “want to hurt” him. This can be a simple way of saying she doesn’t want to break up, but it also calls back to the characterization of them both as criminals, who each might hurt the other. In a way, this marks a sobering up from the impetuous bravado of “...Ready For It?,” acknowledging that, yes, maybe this is worth saving. 

She’s also having a great time doing it! The music video features parties in Miami, Tokyo, and London where Taylor is seen laughing with friends. 

## I Did Something Bad

![Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d3b35e6cccc902b5f7f4d200edbebe0/tumblr_inline_ospgts2pIU1rrrnhe_400.gifv)

<small>*There will be no further explanation.*</small>

But if we must: “I Did Something Bad” marks a clear turning point for Taylor and her “old self.” From the sharp contrast between the optimistic “End Game” and *this*, we can infer the relationship turned sour, as did her public image. Narratively, the song propels us into the beginning of the end of Old Taylor. Let’s start at the beginning...

The track starts with staccato strings, which set the mood for a devilish, villainous atmosphere. We then get the first line “I never trust a narcissist / But they love me.” Already a lot to unpack here! Taylor is clearly leaning into the irony of the line, calling someone else a narcissist while claiming they love her. Is she saying then that she cannot be trusted since she too is a narcissist? This plays into the line “I don’t trust nobody / And nobody trusts me” in “Look What You Made Me Do” perfectly, as she cannot trust anyone else since they are narcissists and no one can trust her as she’s a narcissist. There is also another level of irony though, which is the established “face” of Taylor portrayed in the verses of the songs. These are not Taylor’s genuine feelings, but rather those of a character she feels forced upon her. This becomes more apparent with the next lines “So I play ‘em like a violin / And I make it look oh so easy.” The media has painted this picture of Taylor as a master manipulator, both on a personal and career level, saying that she plays the victim to garner sympathy but commits her own calculated actions that are equally as bad. Here, Taylor takes on this act, saying that she really is this puppeteer, masterminding everyone around her with ease. Going even *further*, there is a third level of depth to this line which is when you take it within the context of the overall album. In this interpretation, the narcissists in question are the media, who love to write headlines about Taylor as a villain. So, exactly as she does in this song, she plays into their expectations of her to show exactly how ridiculous they are, a tactic also used on LWYMMD. In both songs, Taylor anticipates the negative media reaction to both stemming from the fact that the media will take the songs at face value, confirming their preconceptions of her. However, she is one step ahead, “playing [them] like a violin” with intentionally inflammatory songs knowing their response in advance. If this sounds confusing, wait until the section on LWYMMD for a more concrete explanation!

This first opening stanza also echoes the same sentiment as “...Ready For It?” of both her and her lover being “guilty” or otherwise criminal. Overall, not a perfect relationship! We will see this same, bad-loves-bad idea throughout much of the album. 

The pre-chorus introduces the motif of burning, as in burning Taylor alive. Of course, this brings to mind the Salem Witch Trials and general witch hunts. The historical practice has been employed recently to describe unfair public outrage and attacks of people, usually women. It is clear that Taylor feels the subject of such witch hunts. It is also interesting to note that this song was written sometime in 2016 or 2017, following the real-life political witch hunt of Hillary Clinton. What is also interesting with the witch hunt metaphor is that during real life incidents, women were bound to stones and thrown into a river. If they sunk, they were innocent but dead. If they floated, they were guilty and then burned alive. Basically, you were damned either way. Taylor has spoken out since the release of *reputation* as feeling this exact way surrounding her political involvement: if she did not speak out, she was criticized; if she did, she was seen as a liability. Either way, she can’t win. This also ties into the overall theme of punishment, whether or not such punishment is fair or just. 

Now comes the iconic lyric “If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing / I don’t regret it one bit ‘cause he had it coming.” This is not so important thematically, unless you read it as establishing her newfound independence and freedom from the opinions of others, which it definitely is. Although, as a theme, independence is less prominent here than it was in *1989* and less so than crime. But the line is definitely emblematic of the overall feel of the album and represents a new boldness from Taylor never seen before. However, there is an application of justice at work here whereby Taylor is seem as punished unfairly (i.e. no matter what) but this man “had it coming.” The sentiment of karma and of revenge also features in LWYMMD. 

The chorus then starts off with the rumble of a rolling bass line and the words “They say I did something bad.” The line touches on the concept of Taylor’s reputation (what people are saying about her) being tarnished (they are saying what she did was bad), but notable she never actually utters the words “I did something bad” alone. In fact, she questions the judgments placed on her actions in the first place, once again a rebuke of authorities which have historically held her back and choked her off. “Then why’s it feel so good?” she asks rhetorically, relishing in her personal satisfaction. This unapologetic attitude is written all throughout this song in particular. Indeed, the next stanza she declares she would “do it over and over and over again if [she] could.” This distinguishes itself from past declarations of vengeance in that Taylor here relishes in revenge, using it not just as a means to an end but enjoying the act itself. Put differently, she is enjoying the journey more than the destination itself, a decidedly more wicked route. 

The hook. Just. The hook. Despite having no lyrical content, the pitched down, demonic rattling of Taylor’s voice creates the perfect balance with the string plucking intro to fully realize the vengeful spirit Taylor wields. Between the sharper connotations of a conniving villain and the impressively brute vocalizations, Taylor propels the listener into her jarring, hot-blooded high, while at the same time showing a self-awareness that this is an expression of her anger playing right into her reputation. 

The second verse sees Taylor pushing the role of the villain from vengeful to vengeful *and greedy*. After being criticized in a dispute with Apple Music and Spotify, many people who were used to streaming her music were not happy. [^1] “If he spends my change, then he had it coming” Taylor sings, reiterating her unapologetic attitude towards all her so-called crimes.

The next highly relevant part to this song is the bridge, which completes the witch hunt motif.

> They’re burning all the witches
>
> Even if you aren’t one
>
> They got their pitchforks and proof
>
> Their receipts and reasons...
>
> So light me up...
>
> Go ahead and light me up

Of course, Taylor acknowledges the fact that this persona in the song is just a character. She’s neither a witch nor a supervillain, but it doesn’t matter. People believe what they believe and her reputation speaks for itself. People will come to the conclusion before the facts and use any “receipts and reasons” to back up their opinion after the fact. This was indeed a lot of the rhetoric surrounding Taylor from 2016-2017 and, despite having a relatively minor fight by celebrity standards, digital “newspapers” began dragging up things from 2008 to justify their narrative that Taylor was always such a villain. It didn’t matter what the “truth” was, only people’s perception of it. Taylor resigns from the argument altogether, going with the theme of her reputation dominating her true self. It also marks a crucial lesson in our protagonist’s journey of learning to value what truly matters, the opinions of people who care about you, over what doesn’t, the opinions of people who do not. It doesn’t really matter whether or not she is this villain. It doesn’t matter to the accusers and it no longer matters to Taylor. Instead, she shrugs her shoulders and says “If I’m a witch, then light me up,” an incredibly powerful statement.

A subtle reference here is that all of this bridge is auto-tuned very similarly to Kanye West’s “YEEZUS” tour rants. [^2] [^3] By this, Taylor implies that the so-called reasons for her negative depictions stem largely from the falling out she had with Kanye. I don’t believe this significantly contributes to the themes of the album, but I suppose it’s interesting regardless. 

## Don’t Blame Me
Narratively, “Don’t Blame Me” is the point where Taylor starts falling for her long-term love interest beyond anything before. Whereas before she was trapped in a relationship and looking for a way out, now she is looking in, unable to pull away from the relationship established with this man. In the title, there is of course the same theme of crime, punishment, guilt, and innocence going on here. 

We start with a similar character to the one Taylor was playing just last song: “I’ve  been breakin’ hearts a long time / And toyin’ with them older guys / Just playthings for me to use.” At first, Taylor conforms to her reputation for being a serial dater, particularly with older men, but despite the age gap, she is the one in control. It also calls back to “...Ready For It?” with the line “[He] knew I was a robber first time that he saw me / Stealin’ hearts and runnin’ off and never sayin’ sorry.” So, in the early stages of the album, it’s clear that Taylor definitely has the reputation for being a heart-breaker and a player.

However, the verse changes quickly when “something happened for the first time in the darkest little paradise,” making Taylor pace and need him. Drawing from “Delicate,” this dark paradise might have been a night club or dive bar where her and her lover met up; drawing from *Lover*’s “Cruel Summer,” it might have been his house. Either way, she’s meeting up with a man who is clearly new to her life in some regard. 

The pre-chorus marks a narrative shift where, now, Taylor is no longer the predator, but the prey: “For you... I would waste my time.” He is worth changing her ways for, a similar theme to “End Game,” but with a darker, devotional twist including losing her mind. Her reputation comes up again when Taylor informs us that “they say ‘she’s gone too far this time.’” This is also strangely parallel to “I Did Something Bad,” where critics are deploring Taylor’s actions, but she no longer cares.

From here, the chorus is fairly uneventful in terms of narrative or theme. Besides the general idea of a toxic relationship again echoed from “...Ready For It?” and a renouncing of her ways showcased in IDSB, there’s nothing more here.

## Delicate
This track, however, shows the first real vulnerability from Taylor on *reputation*. Even with “End Game,” there was a sense of playfulness and a desire for more, but Taylor was optimistic about it despite it seeming one-sided on her part. “Delicate” presents the very honest, genuine consequences of having a tarnished reputation: your love life. While Taylor can lean into the satire and portray all the parodies she wants, that isn’t the true her. This idea of the “heel” and “face” first starts appeaing in this song. The “heel” is the villainous side to someone; the “face,” the heroic. With “Delicate,” Taylor starts showing her face more, but at the cost of reckoning with her reputation.

An autotuned voice starts us off:

> This ain’t for the best
>
> My reputation’s never been worse, so
>
> You must like me for me

Taylor is confronting a relationship which is “doomed from the start” due to her anxieties about its viability. She is worried, convinced even, that this is not “for the best,” and cannot be a good road to go down. However, she then has a strange sense of reassurance in the fact that her reputation is already the worst it can possibly get, so really what worse could happen? Her lover is finding her at her worst, so she knows that his love for her is genuine. Beyond genuine, he loves her instead of her status, money, or celebrity, which we will see more of in “King of My Heart.” Thematically, this is groundbreaking for the album and shows Taylor that, yes, while reputation is important, what is more important is character and the people who truly love you know your character before your reputation. It is *because* she has a bad reputation that she knows his love is solid. The theme of finding love not just despite but because of the chaos is also touched on in Taylor’s poem “If You’re Anything Like Me.”

> We can’t make
>
> Any promises now, can we, babe?
>
> But you can make me a drink

Just like reputation, we see Taylor’s views on love mature here too. Whereas before, they were presented in very stark terms: reputation does not matter, I love you so much I would lose my mind, I hate you so much I don’t regret anything I did, etc. Now they are presented more nuanced: maybe my reputation does matter, but the people who really know me know my character; I can’t say that I love you yet, but let’s give it a chance; etc. Compared to “Don’t Blame Me,” Taylor is using a much more conversational tone and second-person pronouns all the way through, which helps to show that she is actually communicating with him. It’s subtle things like this that go a long way at separating the lust of “Don’t Blame Me” from the infatuation of “Delicate.” 

> “Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?”
>
> Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
>
> “Come here, you can meet me in the back”

The quotes on the lyrics to the chorus here are mine because I believe this stanza is, in line with the beginning of the song, a conversation. 

## Look What You Made Me Do
And now we have arrived. The song that started it all. A song so deeply entrenched with Taylor’s mythos (and yes, concerning the sheer level of symbolism and references in the track and video, I feel comfortable calling it such) it’s almost impossible to do it justice. There are three different readings for this track: that concerning her real-life feuds and the specific details and references; her overall media reputation; and her relationship with her label, Big Machine Records. We will only be focusing on the latter two, as I feel those are more in-line with what Taylor actually wanted to convey.

### Overall Reputation
Reading the track this way, we see Taylor once again assuming a satirical caricature of her reputation in the media. However, she does not stop at just one character, à la “Blank Space.” No, she does practically **all** of them. With this in mind, let’s first start with the track.

It opens with a grand overture reminiscient of “Nightmare Before Christmas” meets “Phantom of the Opera.” This then shows a strong contrast with the drop into the rest of the song, which is a thumping, bass-heavy, dark pop track. Taylor punctuates “I don’t like your little games / Don’t like your tilted stage,” referring to the media’s unfair treatment of her. This basically ties back to the cover art of the album itself, with the incessant, ugly words of the media dominating Taylor herself, who remains chained and held back from speaking up. She can’t win either way here. No matter what, people will force her into the “role... of the fool,” whereby nothing she does is right and everything she does (including what she does not do) is wrong. She becomes the butt of every joke, as anyone who remembers the constant “snake” jokes can attest to. This line is also a nod from Taylor that she is in fact playing a role here. At least in the media’s eyes, she has no choice. They are going to say that “the gun was [hers]” anyways e.g. that she is guilty of any drama involving her. Either she plays into the roles they create for her (e.g. manipulative villain, serial dater, faux victim) or she is mocked. The next stanza goes on saying that Taylor doesn’t “like your perfect crime / How you laugh when you lie,” where the “you” here is the media. Everyone from gossip blogs [^4] [^5] to real newspapers [^6] [^7] to SNL [^8] contributed to this cartoonish reputation Taylor had acquired, and at the same time they were making fun of her, they were stoking flames of genuine concern that she represented a threat to the entertainment industry. The media was laughing at the same time they were lying, once again showing that the truth is far from the most important thing to somebody’s reputation. Far more important, Taylor shows us, is the narrative the person fills. In this, she became blamed for things not even her doing. In other words, she felt framed or like the media had “said the gun was [hers].”

We then arrive at the pre-chorus, with Taylor fully addressing the media saying:

> Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time

Besides being a rather iconic line, this also brings up an important motif throughout this song and Taylor’s overall return to the spotlight. Making a reference to the rather disturbing mural painted below:

![A mural which reads "In Loving Memory of Taylor Swift 1989 - 2015. No tags please respect the dead."](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/482179/taylor-swift.jpg)

Taylor embraces the narrative that she is “dead,” “over,”and “cancelled.” Once again, we see Taylor leaning into her reputation. However, this time, she places a twist on it: she has resurrected. Perhaps she once was dead, but she has now risen and is “smarter” and “harder” than she was before. Narratively, this is the point we now have two characters develop: the Old Taylor, who died, and the New Taylor, who came back alive. Old Taylor here represents the Taylor who cared about her reputation, who was then killed off by the media. New Taylor is the Taylor writing the latter half of the album, who learns the true value of a reputation, which is that of those she is closest to. In fact, LWYMMD marks the last time on the album we see Taylor leaning into the reputation she has acquired and playing satirical characters. And she decides to make it go out with a bang!

Symbolically, this line sees Taylor referencing the ouroboros, or “tail-eater.”

![Ouroboros featured in the lyric video for the song](./reputation-review-ouroboros.png)

The ouroboros is a snake which represents eternal life and resurrection by eating its own tail. Taylor is, of course, referencing her widespread branding as a “snake,” meaning an untrustworthy, treasonous person. However, she is reclaiming that label to instead mean something powerful, taking inspiration from snakes’ long association with resurrection and eternal life. This also brings the “I do it all the time” line more into focus, emphasizing that this is not just a one-time deal, but a cycle which continues eternally. She is able to withstand the immense pressure and hostility from the media and reinvent/resurrect herself entirely. With resurrection, Taylor avoids the Buffy-esque “she came back wrong” narrative and instead declares “I came back *right*.” Rather than avoid the downfall she has had, she embraces it, seeing it as the downfall of a weaker part of her character which she was now risen above.

Taylor then says that she has “a list of names and yours is in red, underlined,” which is a reference to the character Arya Stark from *Game of Throne*’s “kill list.” Arya, like Taylor, has a list of people she has a personal vendetta against and crosses their names off her list once she kills them. Unlike Arya, Taylor checks this off not once, but twice. She has one person on her list, but why two? Who’s the second? *Herself!* After killing off the Old Taylor, she is able to rise and finally free herself from her reputation. This is one of the cleverest lines on the album, and really hammers home the theme: only by freeing yourself from your reputation, can you become your authentic self and find happiness. 

The chorus is rather simple, just consisting of the eponymous phrase “look what you made me do.” This, of course, begs the question “what *did* she do?” This line is a parody much in line with “I Did Something Bad” with the idea that she “plays the victim.” She’s playing into the character of a self-victimizer who, after just having killed somebody and enacting their revenge, says “they made me do this.” This is actually a fairly common technique from abusers to shift the blame to their victims, saying that if the victim wasn’t so \<adjective\>, they wouldn’t have abused them. Obviously, this is a very troubling, disturbing mentality and Taylor is leaning into the “guilty victim” character the media has constructed for her. However, Taylor is also referring to the fact that she has to play through the cultural narrative and characters around her persona in order to be understood. She has to give the media what they want in order to free herself from it. By giving in, by playing the parody, Taylor is able to make peace with the events that have transpired and move on.

Here, Taylor really shows her mastery over her reputation. She writes intentionally inflammatory lyrics, knowing exactly what the response will be: critics will say the chorus is playing the victim yet again. Only be showing that she is aware of this response beforehand and playing a game of “gotcha!” can she show them that no matter what she does, she is at a loss. A “tilted stage” indeed. 

The second verse then starts with “I don’t like your kingdom keys / They once belonged to me.” The kingdom keys Taylor is referring to in this reading are the metaphorical keys to the kingdom of fame, to the massive media empire she has found herself in since she was a teenager. Once at the height of the world, with tons of BuzzFeed listicles and quizzes singing her relatable praise, Taylor owned these keys. Her word could move Apple Music and an entire conversation around the streaming economy. But those keys were taken from her. And there’s a double meaning here where she doesn’t like them because she envies the days they were hers, but she also doesn’t like them because she has moved on and realizes they no longer matter. We see this similar sentiment echoed more definitively in “Call It What You Want,” where she says “they took the crown but it’s alright.” Taylor describes the media as asking her “for a place to sleep,” but then “lock[ing] her out,” showing the betrayal she felt at the hands of the same organizations who, just months before, praised her. Such is the nature of the entertainment industry and, more thematically, reputation. Unlike character, which is fairly stable and fixed, reputation can fluctuate at any point depending on the numbers of recent retweets. When the media needed her for clicks and for sales as “feminist, relatable, uber-successful Taylor Swift,” then she invited them in, gave them interviews, Instagrammed to everyone’s liking, answered questions, etc. But when that got stale, the same media that she had given a place inside her “home” slowly began taking away her former praise. Was she so feminist after all? Is this millionaire relatable? How is her next album going to top *1989*? The tide was turning and she was locked out, with no way or place to change it. Thematically, Taylor is discovering how reputation is almost entirely out of your control, unlike character, and so you should concern yourself far more with *who you are* rather than *what people say* about you.

Taylor moves on to describing how for the media, the damage to her reputation is no concern. “The world moves on, another day, another drama” after all. Just as quickly as they needed to throw her under the bus to jump on the trend of hating her, they will move to someone else soon enough. Taylor, however, is obviously personally affected. “But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma” she sings, telling us that what might be routine for the media deeply affects her. Her reputation has always been something she has been attuned to, whether that is writing the entirety of *Speak Now* because people said she didn’t write her own music, satirizing the serial dater character in “Blank Space,” or “shaking off” the criticism lobbed at her. Taylor has always taken cues from the industry and from the general public’s opinion of her: perhaps too much. By being so concerned with her reputation, she has set herself up for inevitable failure because, as the phrase goes, you can’t please everybody. When she says “all I think about is karma,” Taylor is not being literal but rather acknowledging what people are expecting from the album, and lead single, which is a vengeful, drama-filled retort at her enemies. Her reputation at the time was that of a drama queen who always has feuds and holds grudges, so this is Taylor leaning into that character.

But just how much of that is satire? The first half of *reputation* reflects Taylor’s mindset just after her downfall, which you would expect to be very angry and vengeful indeed. So, this could be Taylor’s way of genuinely detailing her desire for revenge at the time. “How sloppy! Which is it?” you say! Can’t Taylor make up her mind? Well, I actually believe that this haziness, this uncertainty, is part of the point. By forcing you to interpret these lines as either satirical (she did not actually want revenge) or genuine (“Taylor Swift is so petty and childish omg”), Taylor is showing the duality of her reputation itself. Either you believe she is good or bad, but there were/are very few in the middle. This reflects the cover of the album in which Taylor is seen in black and white, or rather black *or* white. The media treated her this exact way as well. It’s hard to describe just how quickly the tide changed against her, from an entire industry being behind the “America’s relatable sweetheart” narrative one minute and behind the “self-victimizing, lying, manipulative, controlling, white feminist, racist drama queen” the next. Indeed when *reputation* came out, there were reports of her being a white supremacist, Trump supporter, Nazi sympathizer, and alt-right member, all of these reported seriously. This, despite the fact that Taylor was literally photographed in a picture captioned “#hillary2016.”

Moving on, the bridge! Here we see Taylor returning to the theme of “trust.” Seeing as she was called a snake e.g. untrustworthy, she fully embraces that here as well, with an additional callback to the “I Did Something Bad” attitude of “This is how the world works / You gotta leave before you get left.” Taylor’s line here “I’ll be the actress starring in your bad dreams” is about as on the nose we’re gonna get saying that she is playing (i.e. acting) a character fulfulling everybody’s negative perceptions about her (bad dreams). Embracing that reputation, instead of trying to control or manipulate it, is what sets her free. Which also brings us to the famous line:

> I’m sorry, the old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now.
>
> Why?
>
> Oh, ‘cause she’s dead!

By playing into her own reputation, something which has chained her up (remember the cover) and kept her captive (whether that be due to her own concern over it or not)  most of her career, Taylor has finally freed herself, by killing that part of her which was concerned with reputation. Instead of trying to project an image to change her reputation (even “Shake It Off” was a positive response to criticism), Taylor relinquishes it here. Of course, she comes back, thereby becoming the ouroboros. 

Now that we have established the lyrical content and the motifs, themes, and characters it introduces, we can finally take to the video. The video itself is a sort of “proof” that Taylor’s reputation precedes her and she intentionally delayed its release giving the media ample time to play exactly how she anticipated. Then, once they went with their exact wrong impressions, she released the video, flipping the script entirely and showing them how satirical and self-aware the song truly is. Overall, a genius maneuver and I honestly do not think I’ll see something quite like this again in my lifetime. Remember that this is still under the reading that LWYMMD is a response to the media! Note that to cut down on the amount of images needed to show this part, since it is a visual analysis, I will be using timestamps instead of screenshots. I will also not be mentioning Easter eggs which, while cool, do not contribute to the overall analysis (e.g. Nils Sjöberg).

We open with an aerial shot over a medieval castle and cut to Taylor’s grave at 0:13. Already! We have something here! The fact that this is a medieval castle is no accident and references the “kingdom” Taylor talks about in the second verse, which represents being in the top elite of the industry. Notably, Taylor is buried outside of this kingdom, going with the line that they “locked her out and threw a feast.” The Taylor which climbs out of the grave (0:20) is the “New Taylor.” At 0:25, at the same time the lyrics “Don’t like your tilted stage” play, New Taylor grabs a headstone and forces the world to be on even ground again. Despite the world being tilted, she herself was not, showing that Taylor was playing fair and honest while others were not. It also serves as New Taylor saying that she is going to set the record straight and make the stage even again.

We see New Taylor digging a grave and we see at 0:34 that she is burying... herself! Specifically, her at the 2014 Met Gala, which marked the beginning of the *1989* era. Symbolically, Taylor is burying the past and Old Taylor and is ready to move on. We then immediately cut to the first of many characters of Taylor, the millionaire bathing in diamonds *while* decked out in full diamond jewelry as well.

At 0:50, we get our first look at the “Snake Queen” character and admittedly I still get chills from this scene. Once branded a masterminding, controlling snake, we now see Taylor taking both parts of Snake Queen to full effect. She takes the throne surrounded by snakes at her feet (serving her tea), showing her reclamation of the name this entire era. Decked out in full snake jewelry (which she ended up commercializing and making massive amounts of money from), Taylor embraces the reputation she has been given to its extreme. We also see two large columns flanking her reading “ET TU BRUTE,” a reference to the *Julius Caesar* line spoken by King Julius Caesar before his death at the hands of his best friend, Brutus. The connection here is fairly straight-forward: Taylor feels betrayed by her closest friends and those who feigned loyalty to her, only to sabotage her the first chance they got for popularity, approval, or clout.

Attention-seeking Taylor crashes a solid gold car at 1:06 and makes sure to pose with her Grammy at 1:13, surrounded by paparazzi. This could be taken a number of ways, but I believe (1) the crash was intentional and (2) the attention-seeking character called the paparazzi specifically to get photographed.

At 1:20, we see the “gilded prisoner” Taylor, donning a stylish take on the typical orange prison uniform. In fact, that’s part of the irony. She’s wearing these beautiful clothes with her makeup done and her hair styled, even eating lobster meals (1:33) ... but she’s still in prison. The security guards aren’t to keep other people out; they’re to keep her in. Once again, we return to the narrative that Taylor has been imprisoned, drawing from the cover art and “Getaway Car,” due to her criminal nature, from “..:Ready For It?” and again “Getaway Car.” Her crime? Whatever people have decided as the crime du jour.

1:35 sees the money-hungry, greedy character robbing the creatively-named “Stream Company” AKA Spotify which Taylor had a very public falling out with in 2015. She was generally labelled as asking for too much money (despite voicing her concerns for younger, less established artists). [^1] [^9] So, this Taylor relishes in that characterization: robbing a bank with a solid gold baseball bat in a designer outfit. Even more, we see her at 1:46 literally burning the very money she just stole. At 1:52, we see the “cult leader” Taylor, commanding an entire fleet of her plastic followers, which represent Taylor’s “squad” of friends she had before her downfall. The media criticized her friend group as not being the “right kind” of friends; they were too pretty, too thin, too tall, too like Taylor Swift. [^5] They were “elitist Nazi Barbies.” [^10] So, Taylor takes that same ridiculous premise to its logical conclusion. She stands above a plastic army of girls, each indoctrinated with the message “SQUAD U” as in “Squad University,” wearing a leather outfit which all in all invokes a lot of fascist iconography. Note also that these robots are wearing key earrings, as in the aforementioned “kingdom keys,” referring to the idea that Taylor was gatekeeping Hollywood with her friend group. That she was essentially a kingpin shooting down anyone who dare opposed her. I think the reaction shows far more about women in Hollywood than the squad itself, but this post is already too crazy long!

2:02 sees a dismantled heap of these robots, showing that they were fake friends which Taylor has since dismantled and disbanded. Although it is only just a flash, I think 2:02 marks one of the strongest images out of the entire video. On a meta level, here we have Taylor portraying this entire ludicrous, parodied scenario where her friends are plastic robots with keys to Hollywood just for the sake of making the viewer understand how far-fetched her reputation was. She lays above their disassembled robot parts, reflecting the real life dissolution of her friend group due to the drama she had faced because it was too scandalous that a woman should have successful friends who support her. Taylor now creates this ridiculous parody video of her own life as to say “Are you happy now? I have no friends now, are you happy?” 

Anways, skipping ahead to 2:22, we see the famous “Taylor Mountain.” Here, Taylor from this album is killing off all of her old selves. Once again, this fortifies the motif of resurrection and Taylor killing off the old parts of herself (represented as literal characters) to move on from her reputation and its control over her. So, when she kills them (2:51), this is not her way of killing her past selves and accomplishments per se, but rather killing her attachments to them from necessity to survive. It’s a sad moment, but as beloved as these past selves are, none escaped unscathed by the media and only the New Taylor from this album is able to.

### Big Machine Records
Going back to lyrical content, we now have an entirely new context in mind while reading. This reading is much newer in terms of its evidence, as the details are slowly coming out from Taylor’s falling out with BMR. Note that compared to the above reading, this is much more specific and, in my opinion, does not contribute to the theme of the overall album as much. That said, it has places where the explanation feels more straight-forward than it does in the above interpretation and not every track needs to contribute to the theme in the first place.

“I don’t like your little games / Don’t like your tilted stage” is referring to the uneven power dynamic between Scott Borchetta and Taylor. Scott has owned all of Taylor’s masters since she was 15 years old. A bit of terminology here: “master recording rights” refers to the rights to a song, including the right to license its use for other purposes (e.g. streaming, commercial uses, movie appearances, etc.). “Masters” is an abbreviated term meaning “master recording rights.” Note that while this particular battle is specific to Taylor, it is applicable to the music industry as a whole. BMR’s games in this case are contractual hoops they are setting for Taylor since her initial six album deal is complete with *reputation*. On the topic of power dynamics between Scott and Taylor, the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40RsbcFRwNA) for her new documentary, *Miss Americana*, shows Taylor revealing:

> “Throughout my whole career, label executives would just say ‘A nice girl doesn’t force their opinions on people. A nice girl smiles and waves and says “thank you.”’”

We can definitely gather then that the next lyric “The role you made me play / Of the fool, no, I don’t like you” is referring to the public persona pushed onto Taylor by Scott, cultivating her “American Sweetheart” image since 2006. “I don’t like your perfect crime / How you laugh when you lie” is referring to the shady practices of BMR, who has had a complicated history since Taylor left, giving statements conflicting with hers. [^11] “You said the gun was mine / Isn’t cool, no, I don’t like you” refers to Scott’s painting of Taylor as the one who is being unreasonable or demanding, despite the draconian terms of his proposal. [^12]

The pre-chorus, then, refers to Taylor’s switch to Republic Records, who gives her her masters. This is her being “smarter... in the nick of time” i.e. before she signed another deal with BMR. “In the nick of time” here makes more sense assuming that Scott’s proposal was, as deals like this always are, time-sensitive and Taylor was effectively racing against all other buyers. Taylor saying “Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time” can still be a reference to the widespread bullying she received for being “dead,” “over,” or “cancelled,” but this time directed at Scott, who may have been putting pressure on her to complete her sixth album. This would make sense if Scott wanted to begin negotiating sales of BMR and Taylor’s masters which he could only do once she was contractually free from their previous agreement. The next stanza, however, becomes especially dark if you consider this reading with Taylor declaring that she has “a list of names and yours is in red, underlined.”

Moving on to the chorus, this time “look what you made me do” refers to Taylor switching labels from BMR to Republic, despite having to give up all possibilites of owning her masters. To her, this would have been a massive decision and she is telling Scott essentially that the situation could have been worked out if he was more reasonable, but now look at what she’s had to do.

The second verse’s “I don’t like your kingdom keys / They once belonged to me” makes much more sense here when interpreted this way. The “kingdom keys” here are the ownership to Taylor’s masters which she believed she would eventually (and rightfully) own. When Scott “asked [Taylor] for a place to sleep,” she is calling out the fact that she took a risk signing to his new record label at such a young age, but she did because she believed in him and she trusted in his perspective on her art. She also makes up most of BMR’s revenue and allows Scott to “sleep” or not have to work for the money since she brings most of it in. The shade! Then, of course, Scott “locked [her] out and threw a feast. What?!” He refused to give up ownership of her masters, thereby locking her out of her own creations and the artwork she had built up since she was 14, throwing a feast for himself and BMR stakeholders with the $300+ million deal to Ithaca Holdings. The infuriating unfairness here is, of course, most of that evaluation came from Taylor herself, who was given no say in this sale or deal or, if she was, was given a deal which would effectively imprison her for 7-10 more years. [^13] The idea of imprisonment returns to the cover, where this is Taylor’s mugshot for her imprisonment under BMR. For everyone else, “the world moves on, another day, another drama.” This will be just another headline, another retweet, another public scandal, but for Taylor, “all she thinks about is karma.” This is her entire life’s work and she is thinking about how to get even. Now, this can mean legally obtain her masters or the pure and simple thirst for revenge.

The bridge is also very telling underneath this interpretation. She doesn’t trust Scott and he doesn’t trust her. What they both want is mutually exclusive here and so they are locked in a battle on a “tilted stage” where Taylor is at a severe disadvantage. The Old Taylor being dead is the fact that Taylor’s first six albums are now effectively dead, as she is walking away from them knowing that she likely won’t ever get them back. Indeed, Taylor does say: “I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, Scott Borchetta would sell the label, thereby selling me and my future. I had to make the excruciating choice to leave behind my past.”

This reading actually makes sense once you consider Taylor’s other statement in that post: “For years I asked, pleaded for a chance to own my work.” After the massive success of *1989* in particular, Taylor was likely very keen on getting her masters, and Scott on keeping them. Thus, by the time *reputation* was being made, the battle with Scott was already years under way and Taylor had already made up her mind as to leaving without her masters. The one year delay of *reputation* itself also makes sense if Taylor was using the former contract with BMR requiring her six album quota as some sort of leverage. 

### In Conclusion
LWYMMD is one of the most layered, complicated, masterfully handled songs I have ever seen. The narrative that it tells, symbols it utilizes, and motifs it introduces are fascinating and completely unlike anything Taylor has written before. Even the analysis on the release itself, with Taylor delaying the music video release to prove her own point is so clever and really shows how far Taylor has come since her debut album.

## So It Goes...
When Taylor says that she is in a “gold cage, hostage to [her] feelings,” she means that she is imprisoned due to her love for this person. Unable to act on it due to being trapped in a toxic relationship, she is still in a cage. But this time, it is a golden cage. A cage due to her love and only hostage because she cares about this person so much she can’t turn away from them, but also cannot yet be with them. As far as cages go, this is definitely an improvement! But Taylor has a long way to go until she is truly free. 

On a narrative level, when Taylor says that she “meets [him] in a bar,” because *reputation* is fairly linear, she means that this is the same man from “Delicate.” Here, the narrative is progressing. While she is still worried about the implications of her reputation on this relationship and she has not yet escaped her existing, toxic one, she cannot stop seeing this new man. She finds him magnetic and irresistible, no matter how bad their seeing each other is.
