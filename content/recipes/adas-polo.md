## Ingredients

- 2 cups basmati rice
- 1 cup green lentils (rinsed, not soaked)
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 black pepper
- 1 tbsp salt
- 1/3 cup black raisins
- 1/4 tsp saffron
- 3 tbsp boiling water
- 2 tbsp grapeseed oil + some for raisins

### Optional

- 5 halved, pitted dates
- 1/2 lbs. ground beef/lamb
- 1 small onion (if using meat only)

## Instructions

1. Grind saffron in mortar. Pour in 3 tbsp boiling water and set aside.
2. Rinse 1 cup of lentils and put in pot with 2 cups of water to simmer on medium-high heat for 30 minutes.
3. Wash two cups of rice and put in pot. Fill with water until between first and second knuckle on index finger.
4. Cook rice on medium-high heat until tender and water is evaporated.
5. Strain lentils and set aside once done.
6. Strain rice once tender and mix well with lentils.
7. For tahdig, pour 2 tbsp grapeseed oil into pot and coat bottom with rice-lentil mix. Allow to cook on medium heat for 30 minutes.
8. Oil separate pan or pot and pour in 1/3 cup raisins. Add extra rice from pot to raisins. Let cook on medium-high heat for 15 minutes. (Rice-lentil is still cooking over medium heat for a total of 45 minutes.)
9. Pour saffron mix over tahdig pot and serve with raisin mix!

## Notes

- Traditionally, the recipe calls for 5 halved, pitted dates, cooked with the raisins. But this makes the dish very sweet.
- If you want to add meat, finely chop/grate one small onion and add to raisin mix. But you should first fry 1/2 lbs. ground beef/lamb with oil until mostly brown.
