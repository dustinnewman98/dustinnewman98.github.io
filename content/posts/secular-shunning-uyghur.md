In the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), inhabitants – traditionally, the Uyghurs, a Turkic, Sunni Muslim-majority ethnic group – navigate a complex relationship with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) state government, occupying positions of assimilation, resentment, and separatism at various periods. This relationship has both reflected and contributed to the questions, conversations, and confrontations of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, particularly in the context of the War on Terror. While having roots as far back as 1949 with the founding of the PRC, the beginning of the modern Xinjiang question took its modern shape, according to a 2018 report by Maya Wang, with the collapse of the Soviet Union. [^1] The resulting decentralization of the area formerly under Soviet control led to the splintering of newly independent Central Asian states in 1991, raising Chinese concern of separatism of the XUAR, according to Sean R. Roberts. [^2] Further issue was drawn by the rise of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) in 1989, which centered on the belief, described by Andrew Mumford, that “the Turkic-speaking people of Central Asia should be free from either Soviet or Chinese control.” [^3] This situation, of competing ethnic, religious, and political lines, has continued into the present, now colliding and shaping the global dialogue on religious plurality in the post-9/11 climate.

By investigating the details and differing perspectives on the Xinjiang problem, the relationship between modern Muslims and structures of modernity of secularism, biopolitics, and global political states is examined. Specifically, the Xinjiang problem is neither the result of the Chinese state promoting economic advancement of the XUAR residents, nor ethnic cleansing, nor jihadism in isolation, but the struggle between modern Chinese secularism and Islam over the identity of the Uyghur population. The PRC has made this clear through its extensive use of “secularism” as an ideology stressing loyalty to the state above all else, making Islam – in the contemporary global context – fundamentally incompatible with such thought and leading to the “shunning,” in Chad Meister and Paul Griffiths’ terms, of the Uyghur population. [^4]

Embroiled in the international context increasingly realized by globalization and the historical context of the PRC’s effort to consolidate a singular, socialist Chinese state dating back to the rule of Mao Zedong, it becomes clear that it is inadequate to view Uyghur terrorism as a simple offshoot of jihadism. Rather, one must consider the political implications of the ethnic group in the environment it is in, as it is along boundaries where grievances manifest. In 1991, some 200 Uyghur militants attempted to “seize control in a southern township near the city of Kashgar,” an event now known as the “Baren Uprising.” While this siege was unsuccessful for the militants – and, in fact, led to more strict “counter-terrorism” campaigns by the PRC [^5] – its very failure highlights the strength of the PRC. The strength of this central government made it impossible or at least infeasible for Uyghur separatists to form a “terrorist semi-state,” as Mumford would call it. [^6] Therefore, unable to claim any territory of their own, Uyghur terrorist groups or activities are divorced from other jihadist groups, such as Boko Haram or Da’esh, limited by the strength of the government around them. 

The strength of the PRC has further reaching consequences, however. Per Karen Barkey and George Gavrilis, modern proponents of the millet system have claimed it presents solutions to conflicts between religious and ethnic groups, particularly in cases where territorial autonomy is concerned, such as the Xinjiang problem. [^7] However, as we saw from the Baren Uprising, the PRC is too strong of a state to allow instances of autonomy for Xinjiang. As Barkey and Gavrilis predict, “a state that is too strong has little incentive to implement and sustain a millet system; rulers in such a state will prefer to strip communities of special forms of autonomy.” [^8] This is precisely what we see in contemporary Xinjiang; ethnic Uyghur officials in the region are suspected of “disloyalty” to the state and “subject… to detention and possible imprisonment” after reportedly encouraging separatism. [^9] Compounding the strength of the PRC is the role of the modern (secular) nation-state which, according to Saba Mahmood, is to define and demarcate “national minorities,” an act of differentiation whereby the “difference (religious, racial, ethnic) poses an incipient threat to the identity of the nation that is grounded in the religious, linguistic, and cultural norms of the majority.” [^10] While such an aggressive view on secularism counters its purported neutrality, it draws support from Meister and Griffths as well: “It is at least arguably the case that secular groups, perhaps most especially nation-states, are more likely than the religious to shun their aliens and to seek their erasure.” [^11] This preempts the development of a solution as accommodating as the millet system in the XUAR.

Classifying the Xinjiang problem as ethnic cleansing or genocide would simultaneously be too liberal and too damning. Borrowing terminology from David Snow’s framing theory, the PRC has “diagnosed” Islam and Muslim identity (dress, food, the Qur’an, etc.) as a threat to the secular state. [^12] However, the prognosis is not merely to exterminate or evacuate the Uyghur population, but to erase, to shun, any evidence the ethnic group left on the XUAR [^13] and to instead replace the population of suspected separatists into loyal citizens. If the conflict were merely resolved by genocide, the PRC would not go to such extensive efforts to force Uyghurs abroad to return. [^14] This constitutes a more extensive effort by the PRC to force Uyghurs, viewed as a “biological threat infecting society,” to identify with the secular state above all else, including – and especially – Islam. [^15] Within the context of the Global War on Terror, “Uyghurs” – defined by that very identity over a “Chinese” one – anywhere are seen as a threat to society everywhere, a claim that has gotten at least understanding from global governing bodies such as the United Nations. [^16] The PRC therefore is not waging a physical conflict, at least not primarily so, but an ideological one. Its “diagnosis” is not genocide, but “transformation through education,” as Adrian Zenz translates. [^17] Of course, such education is done of secular material: the Chinese language, Chinese law, the virtues of the Chinese socialist government. [^18]

Despite official claims the Xinjiang situation is a campaign of “poverty alleviation,” [^19] it represents a secular shunning – an erasure of all religious and ethnic differences – on the part of the PRC. Even after assimilation efforts by Uyghurs, “those who seek to take advantage of these opportunities remain under scrutiny as potential terrorists unless they literally condemn their own ethnic heritage.” [^20] This demonstrates the biopolitical nature of the conflict, one that combines the ethnic and cultural battle against the Uyghurs as a “viral” population with the secular regulation of religion. [^21] Disguised as a good-natured attempt at economic advancement, the Xinjiang problem is an ideological struggle of identity stuck between the mandated Chinese identity, which entails speaking, eating, and dressing Chinese, and the ethnic and religious identity of Turkic Muslims. Such a polarization of the two, which are not inherently mutually exclusive, stems from the modern secular state’s definition of the national minority figure, who represents the internal divisions of the nation, and its regulation of religion. However, in particular, the PRC goes further even than the Western expectation that Islam should be practiced in private and instead expects an absence of Islam entirely.

Starting in the 1950s with the socialist thought reform campaigns of Mao Zedong, the Xinjiang problem has deeply seated roots. However, the strongest by far is the strength of its secular central government, the PRC. This not only prevents an adoption of the millet system, which requires a degree of autonomy and acceptance of difference, but also highlights the insights of Saba Mahmood, who theorized that “secularism” is in fact defined by the regulation of the religious instead of the indifference to it. In the view of the secular PRC, the Muslim Uyghur minority constitutes a biological threat to its central identity. Viewed through David Snow’s framing theory, the diagnosis, then, becomes not total ethnic cleansing, but a hearkening back to the 1949 days of “thought reform” under the name of “transformation through education.” Consequently, the Uyghur population finds itself divorced from the global jihadist movement, unable to occupy territory or share a key figure, which creates the unique signatures of Uyghur terrorism that defy David Rapoport’s four waves theory.
