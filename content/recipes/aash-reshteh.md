## Ingredients

- 1/4 c dried chickpeas
- 1/4 c dried white beans
- 1/4 c kidney beans
- fine sea salt
- ground black pepper
- 1 lbs spinach
- 1 lbs cilantro (about 3 large bunches)
- 1 lbs Italian parsley (about 3 large bunches)
- 2 large bunches dill
- 1 large bunch green onions
- grapeseed oil
- 1 large yellow onion, minced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 c dried green lentils
- 1/2 t turmeric
- 2 quarts water
- kashk, to taste
- 8 oz reshteh (Persian soup noodles)

## Instructions

1. Place chickpeas, white beans, and kidney beans in a medium bowl. Add a generous pinch of salt and 2 cups water. Refrigerate two hours or overnight.
2. The night before or just before cooking, prepare the herbs and greens: Wash spinach, cilantro and parsley, then use a salad spinner to dry very well. Run a knife through the spinach to cut leaves into large pieces. Trim the woody ends from cilantro, parsley and dill so that only leaves and tender stems remain. Roughly chop cilantro, parsley, dill, chives and mint leaves into pieces no larger than a quarter. If preparing ahead of time, wrap chopped greens and herbs in plastic bags and refrigerate overnight.
3. To cook, set a large (at least 10-quart) Dutch oven or stockpot over medium heat and add 4 tablespoons oil. When the oil shimmers, add the chopped onion and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring regularly, until the onion is tender and golden brown, 16 to 18 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.
4. Drain the beans and add to onion along with the lentils, turmeric and 1 teaspoon pepper. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring to coat the beans with oil and spices. Add the chopped spinach and herbs, along with stock or water, and stir to combine. Partly cover the pot with a lid and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer the soup for 1 hour, stirring regularly to prevent the greens from sticking and burning. If the soup remains very thick even after the greens have wilted, add another 1 to 2 cups water, as needed to thin it.
5. The soup should be as thick as a hearty chili. If it’s any thicker, thin it with water, 1/2 cup at a time. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt as needed, accounting for the fact that both the noodles and the kashk are well salted.
6. To serve, ladle soup into individual bowls. Top with kashk to taste.
