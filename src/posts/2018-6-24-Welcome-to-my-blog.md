Hello there! This is my very first post on my new website! ðŸŽ‰ (Let's hope emojis work properly.)

This site will replace my old personal website, a handmade GEOS-OS simulator, which was very beloved to me, but not so much to everybody else. ðŸ˜“ What you see right now is my attempt at a more "professional" (read: conventional) portfolio, although the actual "portfolio" part of that is questionable due to the as-of-yet unfinished projects page. Like the subtitle reads, please excuse the dust!

I'll be using this site periodically to post my more polished and/or helpful thoughts, for random readers or potential employers (ðŸ˜‰) alike. I'm sure it will go through many iterations, as my aesthetic preferences swing rapidly from ultra-minimalist to fervent anti-design. Speaking of which, if my random thoughts ON design interest you, then tune in (hopefully there will be RSS feeds and newsletters soon), because I have A LOT to say. 

Oh, and I do apologize for the rather plain home page. I'm trying to find a good free (in the economic sense of the word (more on 'free' later)) library for SVG animations. Right now, anime.js looks very promising.

Signing off from Texas,
Dustin ðŸ¤
