Hi there! <span aria-label="hand-wave" role="img">👋</span>

My name is Dustin and I'm a Linguistics and Computer Science <span aria-label="tree" role="img">🌳</span> major at [UCLA](https://ucla.edu) <span aria-label="bear" role="img">🐻</span>, graduating June 2020. I am also an incoming software engineer at [Qualcomm Atheros](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/networking) <span aria-label="cellular signal bars" role="img">📶</span>. I am primarily interested in backend development and low-level engineering <span aria-label="ladybug" role="img">🐞</span>, such as embedded systems, operating system kernels, and networking stacks. Basically, I love C. <span aria-label="orange" role="img">🍊</span>
