Hi there! 👋

My name is Dustin and I'm a software engineer at [Qualcomm Atheros](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/networking) 📶. I am primarily interested in backend development and low-level engineering 🐞, such as embedded systems, operating system kernels, and networking stacks. Basically, I love C. 🍊 Other interests include Rust, Go, and C++. 🦀 

I also graduated from [UCLA](https://ucla.edu) 🐻 with a Bachelor’s in Linguistics and Computer Science 🌳.
